## 1. Game Overview

### Core Concept
A simplified MVP version of RuneScape built as a self-contained package using Hyperscape's Entity Component System and multiplayer architecture. The game features classic MMORPG mechanics including combat, skills, resource gathering, and progression in a persistent 3D world.

### Key Features
- Grid-based world with height-mapped terrain
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay
- Skill-based progression system
- Resource gathering and crafting
- PvE combat with loot drops
- Banking and inventory management
- Support for both human players and AI agents

### Target Experience
Players start with minimal equipment and must progress through combat and resource gathering to acquire better gear and increase their skills. The game emphasizes gradual progression and resource management in a shared persistent world.

## 2. World Design

### World Structure
- **Grid System**: World divided into discrete grid cells
- **Height Map**: Vertex-colored terrain with PhysX collision
- **Shared World**: Single persistent world for all players
- **No Occlusions**: Entirely height-map based with no overhangs

### Biome Types
Various biomes with appropriate resources and mob spawns:
- **Mistwood Valley**: Foggy forests with goblin camps
- **Goblin Wastes**: Barren lands dominated by goblin tribes
- **Darkwood Forest**: Dense, shadowy woods hiding dark warriors
- **Northern Reaches**: Frozen tundra with ice caves
- **Blasted Lands**: Desolate areas corrupted by dark magic
- **Lakes**: Fishing spots along shorelines
- **Plains**: General purpose areas with roads and camps

### Difficulty Zones
Four difficulty levels distributed across the map:
- **Level 0**: Starter towns (safe zones)
- **Level 1**: Low-level mob areas (Goblins, Bandits, Barbarians)
- **Level 2**: Intermediate mob areas (Hobgoblins, Guards, Dark Warriors)
- **Level 3**: High-level mob areas (Black Knights, Ice Warriors, Dark Rangers)

### Starter Towns
Multiple starter towns with:
- **Bank**: Item storage facility

- **Random Spawn**: New players randomly assigned to different towns

### Resource Distribution
- **Trees**: Scattered throughout appropriate biomes
