## 🔧 **Development Commands**

### Essential Commands
```bash
npm install      # Install all dependencies
npm run build    # Build all packages  
npm start        # Start the RPG game server
npm test         # Run comprehensive test suite
npm run lint     # Code quality and style checks
npm run dev      # Development mode with hot reload
```

### Package-Specific Commands
```bash
# Work with individual packages
npm run build --workspace=packages/hyperscape
npm run test --workspace=packages/rpg  
npm run dev --workspace=packages/generation
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
npm test                    # All tests across packages
npm run test:rpg           # RPG-specific tests  
npm run test:visual        # Visual/screenshot tests
npm run test:integration   # End-to-end gameplay tests
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Start development server with hot-reload
npm run dev           
# OR
bun run dev

# This starts:
# - Client: http://localhost:3333 (Vite with HMR)
# - Server: ws://localhost:5555/ws (Auto-rebuilds on TS changes)
# - File watcher for automatic server restarts

# The dev server will:
# ✅ Automatically rebuild when you change TypeScript files
# ✅ Restart the server after each rebuild
# ✅ Hot-reload client changes instantly via Vite
# ✅ Show colored logs for easy debugging
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts (3000/3000 in use)**:
```bash
lsof -ti:5555 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:5555 | xargs kill -9
npm start
```

**Tests failing with connection errors**:
```bash
pkill -f "hyperscape"  # Kill any existing Hyperscape processes
npm test
```

**Build errors after updates**:
```bash
rm -rf packages/*/build packages/*/dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Character data reset**:
```bash
# Remove world database to reset all player progress
rm packages/rpg/rpg-world/db.sqlite
npm start
```

### Performance Tips

- **Lower graphics**: Use "Performance" mode in browser settings
- **Close other tabs**: Reduces memory usage for better framerate  
- **Restart server**: If world becomes laggy, restart with `npm start`
- **Clear browser cache**: May help with asset loading issues
