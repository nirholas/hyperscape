# Hyperscape RPG Engine

A comprehensive RPG system built on the Hyperscape 3D multiplayer game engine, featuring RuneScape-inspired mechanics with AI-generated content.

## Overview

The Hyperscape RPG is a persistent multiplayer RPG featuring:
- Real-time combat with melee and ranged weapons
- Skill-based progression system (9 skills)
- Resource gathering and crafting
- Banking and trading systems
- Mob spawning and AI entities
- Comprehensive UI with inventory, equipment, and banking interfaces
- AI agent compatibility through ElizaOS integration

## Quick Start

### TL;DR - Get Playing Fast

```bash
cd packages/hyperscape
bun install
bun run dev
# Open http://localhost:3333 and start playing!
# (No auth setup needed for local development)
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+
- Bun recommended for fastest installation
- 4GB+ RAM (for SQLite database and 3D rendering)
- Modern browser with WebGL support

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperscapeai/hyperscape
cd hyperscape/packages/hyperscape

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server (Privy auth is OPTIONAL)
bun run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3333` and backend on `http://localhost:5555`

> **Note**: Authentication with Privy is **optional**. The app works perfectly fine without it for development/testing. Users will be anonymous but can still play. See "Authentication Setup" below to enable persistent accounts.

### Authentication Setup (Optional)

> **⚠️ OPTIONAL**: You can skip this entire section for local development. The game works without authentication!

Hyperscape uses **Privy** for user authentication, supporting wallet login, email, social accounts, and Farcaster. This enables:
- 💾 **Persistent accounts** across devices
- 🔐 **Secure authentication** via wallet, email, or social
- 🎭 **Farcaster integration** for Frame deployment
- 📊 **Progress tracking** tied to user identity

If you want these features, follow the steps below. Otherwise, skip to "First Time Setup".

#### 1. Get Privy Credentials

1. Go to [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/)
2. Create a new app or select existing app
3. **Enable Farcaster login** in Settings → Login Methods (if using Farcaster)
4. Copy your credentials:
   - App ID from Settings → Basics
   - App Secret from Settings → API Keys

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required: Privy App ID (get from dashboard.privy.io)
PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your-privy-app-id-here
PRIVY_APP_ID=your-privy-app-id-here
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your-privy-app-secret-here

# Optional: Farcaster Frame v2 deployment
PUBLIC_ENABLE_FARCASTER=false
PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:5555
```

#### 3. Start the Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

#### 4. Login Flow

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3333`
2. You'll see a login screen
3. Click "Login to Play" 
4. Choose your authentication method (wallet, email, Farcaster, etc.)
5. After authentication, the game world will load
6. Create your character and start playing!

#### Development Without Authentication

For local development/testing, you can skip authentication by not setting `PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`. The app will fall back to anonymous users with local tokens.

```bash
# In .env, leave these commented out or remove them:
# PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=
# PRIVY_APP_ID=
# PRIVY_APP_SECRET=
```

Note: User progress will not persist across devices without authentication.

#### Migrating Existing Installations

If you're upgrading from a version without Privy:

1. **Install new dependencies**:
```bash
bun install
```

2. **Add Privy credentials** to `.env` (optional):
```bash
PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your-app-id
PRIVY_APP_ID=your-app-id
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your-secret
```

3. **Database migration** runs automatically on next server start
   - New columns: `privyUserId`, `farcasterFid`
   - Existing users continue to work with legacy tokens

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - ✅ Existing users keep their accounts
   - ✅ Legacy auth tokens still work
   - ✅ No breaking changes to existing deployments
   - ✅ Privy is optional - app works without it

### First Time Setup

1. **Authenticate** using Privy (wallet, email, or social login)
2. **Create character** - choose your name in-game
3. **Explore** - Use WASD to move, click to interact with objects
4. **Right-click** for context menus and advanced actions
5. **Open menus** - Use left sidebar buttons for Inventory, Skills, Equipment, etc.

### Configuration

Hyperscape uses environment variables for flexible deployment. The system works great with defaults for local development, but you can customize it for mobile, LAN testing, or production deployment.

**Check your configuration**:
```bash
npm run config:check  # Desktop development
npm run config:check:mobile  # Mobile development
```


### Mobile Development

Hyperscape supports iOS and Android through CapacitorJS.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# 1. Get your local IP for mobile connection
npm run cap:ip

# 2. Export the server URL (use command from step 1)
export CAP_SERVER_URL="http://192.168.1.XXX:3333"

# 3. Start dev server (separate terminal)
npm run dev

# 4. Open mobile app
npm run ios:dev      # or android:dev
```


### Farcaster Frame v2 Deployment

Deploy Hyperscape as a Farcaster mini-app (Frame v2):

#### Prerequisites

1. **Privy configured** with Farcaster login enabled
2. **Public HTTPS URL** (required for Farcaster)
3. **Frame metadata** configured

#### Setup

1. **Enable Farcaster in environment**:
```bash
PUBLIC_ENABLE_FARCASTER=true
PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-game-domain.com
```

2. **Deploy to public URL**:
```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
# Make sure both frontend and backend are accessible
```

3. **Configure Privy for Farcaster**:
- In [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/)
- Go to Settings → Login Methods
- Enable "Farcaster" login
- Add your app's redirect URLs

4. **Test your Frame**:
- Use [Farcaster Developer Tools](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/embed)
- Enter your app URL
- Preview in the embedded viewer
- Note: localhost won't work - use ngrok/Cloudflare tunnel for testing

5. **Share your Frame**:
- Share your app URL in any Farcaster client
- Users can launch the mini-app directly from the Frame
- Automatic Farcaster authentication for seamless onboarding

#### Frame Features

- **Auto-login**: Users are automatically authenticated with their Farcaster account
- **Wallet integration**: Farcaster wallet (Warplet) is automatically connected
- **Identity**: Player progress is tied to Farcaster FID
- **Cross-platform**: Works in Farcaster mobile app and Warpcast

#### Local Testing with Tunnel

For local development testing as a Frame:

```bash
# Install ngrok or use Cloudflare tunnel
npx ngrok http 5555

# Update .env with ngrok URL
PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./world/db.sqlite
WORLD_PATH=./world

# Optional
PUBLIC_CDN_URL=https://your-cdn.com
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-livekit-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-livekit-secret
```

### Database Setup

The RPG uses SQLite for persistence:

```bash
# Initialize database
bun run db:init

# Reset world state (WARNING: Deletes all player data)
bun run db:reset
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Instance Limits**: Recommended 50-100 concurrent players
- **Memory Usage**: ~4GB RAM for full world with all systems
- **CPU Usage**: Scales with player count and active combat
- **Database**: SQLite handles thousands of players efficiently

## API Reference

Query game state via REST API:

```bash
# Get all available state queries
GET /api/state

# Get player stats
GET /api/state/player-stats?playerId=123

# Get world info
GET /api/state/world-info
```

### Action Execution

Execute actions via REST API:

```bash
# Get available actions for player
GET /api/actions/available?playerId=123

# Execute action
POST /api/actions/attack
{
  "targetId": "goblin-456",
  "playerId": "123"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start**
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
