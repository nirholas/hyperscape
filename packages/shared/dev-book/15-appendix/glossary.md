**Avatar** - VRM character model with humanoid rig

**Accumulator** - Time buffer for fixed timestep physics

---

### C

**Component** - Modular data container attached to entities (e.g., HealthComponent, CombatComponent)

**CSM (Cascaded Shadow Maps)** - Advanced shadow rendering technique

---

### E

**ECS (Entity Component System)** - Architecture pattern where entities are composed of components and processed by systems
