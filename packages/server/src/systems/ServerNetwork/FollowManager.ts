/**
 * FollowManager
 *
 * Server-authoritative system for tracking players following other players.
 * Implements OSRS-accurate following behavior.
 *
 * OSRS-style behavior (from wiki):
 * 1. Player right-clicks another player and selects "Follow"
 * 2. Follower walks behind the leader (not on same tile)
 * 3. When leader moves, follower re-paths to stay behind them
 * 4. Following continues indefinitely until cancelled
 * 5. Cancelled by: clicking to walk, trading, equipping items, target disconnecting
 *
 * @see https://runescape.wiki/w/Follow
