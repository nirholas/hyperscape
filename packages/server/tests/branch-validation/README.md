## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Hyperscape server running on `http://localhost:5555`

3. PostgreSQL/SQLite database accessible

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd packages/server
npm test tests/branch-validation
```

### Run Individual Test Files
```bash
# Character selection tests
npm test tests/branch-validation/character-selection.spec.ts

# Character editor tests
npm test tests/branch-validation/character-editor.spec.ts

# Dashboard tests
npm test tests/branch-validation/dashboard-agents.spec.ts

```

## Test Logs

All tests generate detailed logs saved to `/logs/branch-validation/`:

```
logs/branch-validation/
├── character-list-new-fields.log
├── character-create-websocket.log
├── enter-world-valid.log
├── enter-world-auto-create.log
├── duplicate-connection-rejection.log
├── stale-entity-cleanup.log
├── agent-creation-valid.log
├── agent-creation-rollback.log
├── jwt-generation-retry.log

├── snapshot-auto-join.log
├── complete-agent-lifecycle.log
├── agent-crash-reconnection.log
├── agent-deletion-cleanup.log
└── multiple-agents-same-account.log
```

Each log file contains:
- Step-by-step execution trace
- Success/failure indicators
- Data snapshots
- Error messages (if any)

## Authentication Pattern

All tests use the JWT helper from `/packages/server/tests/helpers/auth-helper.ts`:

```typescript
import { createTestUser, createTestAgent } from "../helpers/auth-helper";

const testUser = createTestUser();
// Returns: { userId, characterId, token }

const testAgent = createTestAgent();
// Returns: { userId, characterId, token, isAgent: true }
```

This bypasses Privy authentication for testing while using the same JWT secret as production.

## CI/CD Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:

- ✅ No external dependencies (Privy, etc.)
- ✅ Self-contained test data
- ✅ Deterministic results
- ✅ Fast execution (~2-3 minutes total)
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
